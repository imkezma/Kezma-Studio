        <h1>I'm Abdullah Alkadhem, A Graphic Designer & Front-End Developer</h1>
        <p>
            A skilled web designer and developer with over 10 years of experience in front-end. I have knowledge and experience building responsive and mobile-friendly websites using WordPress and Drupal. I started designing web interfaces while studying digital art during my undergraduate studies as an art education student. This was the beginning of my passion and the journey of learning to design and develop websites. I want to make this knowledge and this tech part of small businesses and service organizations growth in the community.
